### Install
> ❗ Requirements:
> - **`xclip`** (X11)
> - **`wl-clipboard`** (Wayland)
> - **`powershell`** (Windows / WSL)

User your favorite package manager. I use Vundle.

### Usage

Copy an image > go to your Vim > :PasteImage<CR>

That's it. For more, use the source, luke!

### Config
This plugin is **zero config**. Read the Python bits in the source and changing it should be easy enough.
